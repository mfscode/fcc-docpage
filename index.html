            <p>So, what is git?</p>
            <p>Imagine you're making a documentation about an animal, you've researched about that animal and now am ready to write the report.</p>
            <p>After some writing, you research again about that animal and found out that your data is actually incorrect, so you delete the wrong part of your report and write a more accurate one.</p>
            <p>Finally your report is ready, now you submit your report to your teacher, your teacher then store that report in their files. And since you made a copy of your report, you also saved one in your computer just in case the teacher found some
                inaccuracy in your report and ask you to fix it.</p>
            <p><b>That's Git</b></p>
            <p>It helps you to save a version of a file (or in this example, the report in a certain point of time), revert to the previous version of that file (e.g when the change of the file turns out breaking the file, you would like to revert to the
                version before the change), and then publish / store that file to a directory or, what we developer love to call, a repository, whether it's remote (on another side e.g GitHub) or locally in your storage system.</p>
