            <p>So, what is git?</p>
            <p>Imagine you're making a documentation about an animal, you've researched about that animal and now am ready to write the report.</p>
            <p>After some writing, you research again about that animal and found out that your data is actually incorrect, so you delete the wrong part of your report and write a more accurate one.</p>
            <p>Finally your report is ready, now you submit your report to your teacher, your teacher then store that report in their files. And since you made a copy of your report, you also saved one in your computer just in case the teacher found some
                inaccuracy in your report and ask you to fix it.</p>
            <p><b>That's Git</b></p>
            <p>It helps you to save a version of a file (or in this example, the report in a certain point of time), revert to the previous version of that file (e.g when the change of the file turns out breaking the file, you would like to revert to the
                version before the change), and then publish / store that file to a directory or, what we developer love to call, a repository, whether it's remote (on another side e.g GitHub) or locally in your storage system.</p>

                A (kinda) Short History Of Git
            </header>
            <p>As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy.
            </p>
            <p>The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope. During this early years of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991 - 2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, hte Linux
                kernel projecy began using a proprietary DVCS (Distributed Version Control Systems) called Bitkeeper</p>
            <p>In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed Bitkeeper broke down, and the tool's free-of-Charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community
                (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using Bitkeeper. some of the goals of the new system were as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Speed</li>
                <li>Simple design</li>
                <li>Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)</li>
                <li>Fully distributed</li>
                <li>Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities. It's amazingly fast, it's very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system fir nin-linear development
                (See <a href="#">Git Branching)</a></p>
