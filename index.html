            <p>So, what is git?</p>
            <p>Imagine you're making a documentation about an animal, you've researched about that animal and now am ready to write the report.</p>
            <p>After some writing, you research again about that animal and found out that your data is actually incorrect, so you delete the wrong part of your report and write a more accurate one.</p>
            <p>Finally your report is ready, now you submit your report to your teacher, your teacher then store that report in their files. And since you made a copy of your report, you also saved one in your computer just in case the teacher found some
                inaccuracy in your report and ask you to fix it.</p>
